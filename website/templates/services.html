        <h1>Sung Jinwoo the Shadow Monarch</h1>
        <p>In Solo Leveling, Sung Jin-woo is not the Shadow Monarch himself, but becomes a vessel for Ashborn, the previous Shadow Monarch. Ashborn is the most powerful of the Monarchs and ultimately betrays Kandiaru, transferring his powers and the Shadow Monarch's identity to Jin-woo. </p>
